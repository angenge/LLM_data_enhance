Q: There is no doubt that minors should be prohibited from smoking. However, we cannot explicitly ban the use of automatic cigarette vending machines in order to prevent minors from smoking. This ban is just like setting up roadblocks on the road to prohibit driving without a license.

In order to evaluate the above argument, which of the following questions is the most important?
Answer Choices: (a) Does the proportion of underage smokers in the total number of smokers exceed 1%?  (b) How much inconvenience does the ban on the use of automatic vending machines bring to adult cigarette buyers? (c) Whether the proportion of unlicensed drivers in the total number of drivers really does not exceed 1%. (d) Is the harm of minor smoking really as serious as the public thinks?
