Q: Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements. In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. When was the European Coal and Steel Community formed? 2. When did the European Coal and Steel Community become the European Economic Community? 3. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
1. “European Coal and Steel Community in 1951”. The answer is 1951.
2. “European Economic Community in 1958”. The answer is 1958.
3. We know that the European Coal and Steel Community was formed in 1951. We also know that the European Coal and Steel Community became the European Economic Community in 1958. So 1958 - 1951 = 7 years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist. The answer is 7.
So the answer is 7.

Q: In the county, the population was spread out with 23.50% under the age of 18, 8.70% from 18 to 24, 29.70% from 25 to 44, 24.70% from 45 to 64, and 13.30% who were 65 years of age or older. How many more percent are under the age of 18 compared to the 18 to 24 group?
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. What is the percentage of people under the age of 18? 2. What is the percentage of people from 18 to 24? 3. How many more percent are under the age of 18 compared to the 18 to 24 group?
1. “23.50% under the age of 18”. The answer is 23.5.
2. “8.70% from 18 to 24”. The answer is 8.7.
3. We know that 23.5% are under the age of 18. We also know that 8.7% are from 18 to 24. So 23.5% - 8.7% = 14.8% more percent are under the age of 18 compared to the 18 to 24 group. The answer is 14.8%.
So the answer is 14.8.

Q: Playing in their second straight Thanksgiving game, the Eagles struggled especially on defense, where they were unable to stop the much-hyped Lions offense. The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Stafford’s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson?
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. How many TD passes did Stafford throw? 2. How many TD passes did Stafford throw to Jhonson? 3. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson?
1. “Stafford’s five passing touchdowns”. The answer is 5.
2. “Johnson catching 3 touchdowns”. The answer is 3.
3. We know that Stafford threw 5 TD passes. We also know that Stafford threw 3 TD passes to Jhonson. So 5 - 3 = 2 TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson. The answer is 2.
So the answer is 2.
