Q: Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements. In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "The US government negotiated managed-trade agreements since the 1970s. Some examples include the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006, and various bilateral agreements. The European Coal and Steel Community was established in 1951 by six countries in Europe. It evolved into the European Economic Community in 1958, with two primary goals of creating a common market and a customs union between member states. What is the duration of the existence of the European Coal and Steel Community?"
Now, to answer the rewritten question, According to the passage, the European Coal and Steel Community was established in 1951 and became the EEC in 1958. 1958 - 1951 = 7. So the answer is 7.

Q: In the county, the population was spread out with 23.50% under the age of 18, 8.70% from 18 to 24, 29.70% from 25 to 44, 24.70% from 45 to 64, and 13.30% who were 65 years of age or older. How many more percent are under the age of 18 compared to the 18 to 24 group?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "The county's population was distributed into different age groups. 23.50% under 18 years, 8.70% aged between 18 to 24, 29.70% between 25 to 44, 24.70% between 45 to 64, and 13.30% were 65 years or older. What is the percentage difference between the under-18 group and the 18 to 24 age group?"
Now, to answer the rewritten question, According to the passage, 23.5% are under the age of 18, and 8.7% are from ages 18 to 24. 23.5% - 8.7% = 14.8%. So the answer is 14.8.

Q: Playing in their second straight Thanksgiving game, the Eagles struggled especially on defense, where they were unable to stop the much-hyped Lions offense. The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Staffordâ€™s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "The Eagles played in their second straight Thanksgiving game but struggled, especially on defense. They were unable to stop the Lions' much-hyped offense, and rookie Eric Rowe struggled to cover wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who caught three touchdowns. Stafford threw five passing touchdowns, three of them to Johnson. The Eagles gave up 45 points for the second consecutive time this season, resulting in a loss, bringing their record to 4-7 for the season. They have a 6-1 record when playing on Thanksgiving. What is the number of TD passes thrown by Stafford, other than to Johnson?"
Now, to answer the rewritten question, According to the passage, Stafford threw 5 TD passes, 3 of which were to Johnson. 5 - 3 = 2. So the answer is 2.
