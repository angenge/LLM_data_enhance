Q: Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements. In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "Given that U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements since the 1970s, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006, and that in Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which later became the European Economic Community in 1958 with the objectives of developing a common market and establishing a customs union between its member states, how long did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?"
Therefore the answer is 7.

Q: In the county, the population was spread out with 23.50% under the age of 18, 8.70% from 18 to 24, 29.70% from 25 to 44, 24.70% from 45 to 64, and 13.30% who were 65 years of age or older. How many more percent are under the age of 18 compared to the 18 to 24 group?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "Given that in the county, the population was spread out with 23.50% under the age of 18, 8.70% from 18 to 24, 29.70% from 25 to 44, 24.70% from 45 to 64, and 13.30% who were 65 years of age or older, what is the difference between the percentage of people under the age of 18 and the percentage of people from 18 to 24?"
Therefore the answer is 14.8.

Q: Playing in their second straight Thanksgiving game, the Eagles struggled especially on defense, where they were unable to stop the much-hyped Lions offense. The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Stafford’s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson?
