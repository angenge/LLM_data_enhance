Q: From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at. How many sorties were flown in March 1941?
A: Rewriting in simple words, the question is: "Given that from the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement, and that the Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks, and that the electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights, and that ports were easier to find and made better targets, and that to confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell, and that X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute, and that rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at, how many sorties were flown in March 1941?"
Therefore, the answer is "4,000".
